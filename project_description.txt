Title-"Simple Navigator" -[4th semester]
It is AI project given us to find the optimal path between source and destination within university.
So, I mapped a small part locations of university by giving each location a (x,y) co-ordinate to locate its position on my map.
The co-ordinate system will help us to find the distace b/w two location connected by straight path.
I have used the very basic knowledge, data-structures, algorithms and mathematics to accomplish this project, these are mentioned below:
BFS(breadth first search)
recursion
queue
stack
dictionary
pandas
